The dives and snorkels ...
<UL>
<LI> SCUBA 29/10; Myrmidon NW bommies. 30m viz. Lotsa colour and reef fish.
<LI> Snorkel 29/10; Myrmidon SE side. While checking out the edge of
     the continental shelf, everyone got towed behind the boat hanging
     onto a rope. Lots to see.
<LI> SCUBA 29/10; Myrmidon NW gully.
<LI> SCUBA 29/10; Myrmidon NW bay (just north of the admiralty anchor).
<LI> Night SCUBA 29/10; Myrmidon NW bay. Plenty of crustaceans about.
<LI> SCUBA 30/10; The edge of the continental shelf, Myrmidon SE side.
     Wow! Dropped into 30m, and there was the edge heading down SE, too
     deep for normal SCUBA. Headed NW towards the reef, through very rich
     coral and fish life.
<LI> SCUBA 30/10; NW corner of the island bommie at Dip Reef. Not so 
     great, but still worth doing.
<LI> Snorkel 30/10; NW corner of the island bommie at Dip Reef. Much better!
     Plenty of white tip reef sharks.
<LI> Snorkel 30/10; Cotton Shoal. Never have so few seen so much coral
     in such a short space of time. More tabletop coral than you can
     poke a stick at, with lots of other varieties too.
<LI> SCUBA 30/10; Glow Reef. Very very nice. Lovely lumpy coutryside, on
     a sand bottom. Large rays of several types. Sharks too.
<LI> Night SCUBA 30/10; Glow Reef. Crabs, prawns, slipper-bugs, cuttlefish,
     etc, etc, etc.
<LI> SCUBA 31/10; Helix Reef. Swim-through city, with strong coral growth
     and good marine life.
<LI> SCUBA 31/10; Helix Reef. Well, we were going to go to Keeper Reef,
     but everyone liked Helix so much we just had to stay for more.
