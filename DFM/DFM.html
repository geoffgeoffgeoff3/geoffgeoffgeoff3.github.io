<LI> The instigator shall call <STRONG>Squad ... Attention</STRONG>
<LI> The assembled DFMers (that includes the instigator) shall leap to 
     attention, clutching their drinks to the chest, with elbows neatly 
     tucked into their sides.
<LI> The instigator shall call <STRONG>Present Arms</STRONG>
<LI> The DFMers shall raise their elbows to above the drinking level
     (typically the mouth, but DFM has no physiological prejudices), without
     moving the drink from its secure position against the chest. This
     manouvre ensures that there is some space left empty in the elbow should 
     the body fill up to the drinking level.
<LI> The DFMers shall all call <STRONG>Ochlayoch</STRONG> and take a healthy
     slurp.

The above drinking formalism is very effective.
It has been tested under strict partying conditions, and has been proved to
be a reliable way of transferring drink to the body.

<H2>Easter Sunday</H2>

<P>
Easter Sunday occurs every year on easter sunday (notice the subtle change
of capitalization). DFM meets (in several countries now) on the top of the
nearest hill before sunrise, for champagne and pancakes. Then the sun rises.
And people start to sink. And the day progresses. In Townsville we'll be
meeting at the top of Mt Stuart (just behind the university campus), if
you'd like to join us.
